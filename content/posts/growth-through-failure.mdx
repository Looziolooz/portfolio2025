Failure is a powerful teacher. Every bug, crash, and misstep is a chance to grow.

## Embracing Mistakes

Mistakes reveal gaps in understanding and open doors to deeper learning. The best developers aren't perfect—they're persistent.

## Learning From Errors

- **Debug with curiosity**: Ask why, not just how.
- **Document your journey**: Share what went wrong and how you fixed it.
- **Celebrate recovery**: Fixing a bug is a win worth acknowledging.

## Conclusion

Failure is feedback. Embrace it, learn from it, and let it fuel your growth.
