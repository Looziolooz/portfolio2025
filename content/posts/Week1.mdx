This week I began my journey into frontend development. I explored how websites are built and how browsers interpret code.

## What I Learned

- **HTML Basics**: Tags, structure, and semantic markup.
- **CSS Fundamentals**: Styling elements and understanding the box model.
- **Tools Setup**: Installed VS Code and learned to use browser dev tools.

## Reflection

It’s exciting to see how simple code can create visual interfaces. I’m motivated to keep building.
