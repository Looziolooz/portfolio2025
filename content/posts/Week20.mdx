This week I completed my final project and presented it to the class.

## What I Built

- A full React application with routing, API integration, and responsive design.
- Used everything I’ve learned over the past 20 weeks.

## Reflection

This journey has transformed me. I’m proud of my growth and ready for the next challenge.
