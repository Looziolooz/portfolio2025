This week was all about applying what I’ve learned. I built a small project from scratch.

## What I Built

- A responsive website with interactive features.
- Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Fetched data from an API and displayed it dynamically.

## Reflection

Seeing everything come together was rewarding. I’m proud of how far I’ve come in just 10 weeks.
