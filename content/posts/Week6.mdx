This week was all about working with dataâ€”how to store, access, and transform it.

## What I Learned

- **Arrays**: Methods like map, filter, and reduce.
- **Objects**: Key-value pairs and nested structures.
- **Iteration & Transformation**

## Reflection

Understanding data structures is key to solving real problems. I feel more confident writing logic now.
