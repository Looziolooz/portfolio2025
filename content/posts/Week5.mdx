This week I explored how JavaScript connects with the browser through the Document Object Model (DOM).

## What I Learned

- **DOM Traversal & Selection**
- **Event Listeners & Handlers**
- **Creating Dynamic Interfaces**

## Reflection

Itâ€™s amazing how much control JavaScript gives over the page. I can now build interactive experiences.
